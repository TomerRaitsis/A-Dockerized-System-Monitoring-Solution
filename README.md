# Coding for Cloud Efficiency: A Dockerized System Monitoring Solution

This GitHub repository hosts a Python and Flask-based system monitoring application that continuously tracks CPU and memory usage, issuing alerts when usage surpasses 80%. This simple app serves as a tool for optimizing system performance. <br>
<br>
The project primarily revolves around Docker, allowing for seamless containerization, enhancing portability, and simplifying deployment. In addition, the application integrates with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), providing a streamlined solution for image management, storage, and distribution.<br>
<br>
Exploring beyond containerization, this project delves into Kubernetes for orchestration of deployments and services, showcasing the power of container orchestration for managing applications at scale. <br>
<br>
Developed with a focus on learning, this project is mostly about hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes and various AWS services such as EC2, ECR, and EKS. It provides a tangible example of integrating software development, DevOps principles, and cloud infrastructure in action, creating a pathway for efficient and scalable application deployment.
