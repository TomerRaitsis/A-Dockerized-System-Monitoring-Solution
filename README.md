# Cloud-Native-Monitoring-Application

This GitHub repository houses the code for a system monitoring application built with Python and Flask. The app continuously tracks CPU and memory usage, triggering alerts when resource utilization exceeds 80%.
It's designed to help maintain system performance and reliability. The project includes the usage of Docker for containerization, enabling portability and easy deployment.
Additionally, it integrates with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for streamlined image management and explores Kubernetes for orchestrating deployments and services. 
This project was developed for studying purposes, providing a hands-on experience with all these elements. It demonstrates the integration of software development, DevOps practices, and cloud infrastructure in action.
